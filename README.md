PROJECT TITLE: Probability
ABOUT: 1.Probablistically estimates the value of pi by randomly throwing darts(by user input) in a circle of radius 1 inscribed within a square of radius 2.Counts the number of darts that land within circle and finds pi.
2. Simulates the Monty hall problem through probability. First simulation, which doesn't change the player's first choice shows that the winning probabilty is 1/3. Second simulation, which changes the player's first choice after a loosing door is opened shows that the winning probabilty is 2/3.
